 MUST
 ----
 * Add more expression to Morsel.
    * Gradual smile / sad while you're deciding who a morsel is for.
    * Expression for “conflicted” or “uncertain”
    * Perfect the idle loop
    * Then STOP. That's 1.0.

 * Decide on final set of options in Stats / Extras. Color for Morsel, with accompanying app icons, etc.?
    * Colour picker (simple palette of 6 colors, not free-form)
    * App icon changer tied to that colour picker

 * Weekly "Digest"

 * Add an Onboarding of some kind.
    * One screen, super simple, ON the empty state.
    * Animated, beautiful. Can Morsel wave?

 * Decide on £0.99 a year subscription with RevenueCat etc.
    * Fallbacks for missing entitlements / failed purchases
    * Basic crash/error logging (e.g. Firebase or similar)

 * More Analytics events.
    * Ensure all screen views are done.
    * log_craving
    * delete_craving
    * log_meal
    * delete_meal
    * expression_shown (on Morsel)
    * change_setting
    * started_onboarding
    * completed_onboarding
    * tapped_subscribe
    * completed_purchase
    * received_weekly_digest
    * opened_weekly_digest

 SHOULD
 ------
 * More haptics / sound effects (with a toggle in Extras).
    * Tamagotchi gulp when feeding

 COULD
 -----
 * Figure out this custom AppEntity thing for speaking the item in one term to Siri.
 * Add some reminder notifications, NOT NAGS. Maybe with a reminder time? User can select up to 3 times per day?
 * Togglable widget background showing red to green for food for you versus Morsel that day?
 * Daily goal streaks?
 * “Random tip from Morsel” in Extras. Could be serious (“Eat slowly”) or playful (“Ice cream is legal even on Tuesdays”)
