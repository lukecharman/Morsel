/*

 MUST
 ----
 * Clean up Morsel vs. keyboard height once and for all.
    * Maybe he disappears, keyboard opens, then he slides down from the top with a little rope?
 * Add more expression to Morsel.
    * Gradual smile / sad while you're deciding who a morsel is for.

 * Decide on final set of options in Stats / Extras. Color for Morsel, with accompanying app icons, etc.?
    * Toggle for Apple / custom fonts?
    * Always dark / light mode?
 * Add an Onboarding of some kind.
 * Decide on subscription vs. one-off. £1.99 a year? £0.99 a year?
 * Implement IAPs.
 * More Analytics events.

 SHOULD
 ------
 * More haptics / sound effects (with a toggle in Extras).
 * Figure out this custom AppEntity thing for speaking the item in one term to Siri.

 COULD
 -----
 * Add some reminder notifications, maybe with a reminder time? User can select up to 3 times per day?
 * Togglable widget background showing red to green for food for you versus Morsel that day?
