Digest
 * Ensure that the ViewModel is bulletproof and the weekly logic is all from one source of truth, etc.
 * Test the fix for the bug where the unlock of the weekly digest isn't immediate as soon as you tap the notification.
 * Make the unlock itself beautiful. Animation, haptic ‚Äì moment of truth.

Speech Bubble
 * Clean up the speech bubble's visual appearance.
 * Decide logic for when to show a speech bubble.
 * Add a talking animation while the bubble is on-screen.
 * Haptic pattern as the speech bubble appears / disappears
 * Decide on a simple little speech / sound for Morsel.
 * Host a JSON file somewhere to remotely update these small phrases.

Side Panels
 * Decide if the data points are useful enough, add more, clean them up.

Personality
 * Finalise Morsel himself ‚Äì add more expressions and make him feel more alive.

Onboarding
 * Clean up the copy and make it visually nicer. Use Morsel more.

Watch & Widgets
 * Check this is all super smooth and working. No friction. Test what you can.

App Store Stuff
 * Ensure we have all the analytics events we're gonna need.
 * Finalise all app icons ‚Äì we have a set Morsel now so we can do this whenever.
 * Profile for optimisations to memory and framerate, etc.
 * Get it on TestFlight, write a blurb, do screenshots, etc.
 * Use it for a couple of weeks on phone and watch, find bugs, do proper testing.




Post 1.0
--------
 * Food ranking system using an open API or a big local JSON.
 * Figure out this custom AppEntity thing for speaking the item in one term to Siri.
 * Add some reminder notifications, NOT NAGS. Maybe with a reminder time? User can select up to 3 times per day?
 * Togglable widget background showing red to green for food for you versus Morsel that day?
 * Daily goal streaks?





Future Ideas
------------
ü´ß Micro-Reactions (Contextual, Lightweight)

Subtle and ambient behaviours to reflect mood, interaction, or state.
  ‚Ä¢  Glance at user input: If you‚Äôre typing something in the text field, Morsel‚Äôs eyes follow the keyboard or cursor.
  ‚Ä¢  Idle fidgets: Finger tap, ear twitch, slow stretch, light bounce, tiny sneeze.
  ‚Ä¢  Reactive glow: His fill colour pulses or shifts very gently based on time of day or app theme.
  ‚Ä¢  Eye darting: If he‚Äôs idle too long, he looks suspiciously left and right.

‚∏ª

üòÆ Big Emotes (Triggered by Events)

More obvious, more animated. Only for key transitions.
  ‚Ä¢  Happy dance / spin: After a successful add. Maybe even randomise the move slightly.
  ‚Ä¢  Shudder or disgust: When deleting something.
  ‚Ä¢  Impatient tapping or snoring: If left open without input for too long.
  ‚Ä¢  Blush / sparkle: When given a food he ‚Äúlikes‚Äù (i.e. you could add a favourites mechanic).
  ‚Ä¢  Heart bubble: Occasionally floats up from his head when ‚Äúfed‚Äù.

‚∏ª

üéÆ Mini Interactions

Tiny interactions that are not essential but feel delightful.
  ‚Ä¢  Petting: Tapping and holding causes him to smile, melt, or waggle a limb.
  ‚Ä¢  Tilt-based expressions: On device tilt (if phone), his gravity shifts slightly.
  ‚Ä¢  Ticklish spot: There‚Äôs one part of him that reacts differently (corner tap easter egg).
  ‚Ä¢  Dressing up: A small seasonal hat or overlay (e.g. pumpkin, santa hat, sunglasses).

‚∏ª

üß† Behaviour That Learns

This is advanced, but fits your theme of Morsel evolving.
  ‚Ä¢  Mood tracking: Based on how often he‚Äôs ‚Äúfed‚Äù vs. ignored, he could look perkier or a bit sluggish.
  ‚Ä¢  Expression changes over day: Maybe he‚Äôs sleepy in the morning and smug after dinner.
  ‚Ä¢  Custom animation per user: Favourite foods give him unique reactions over time.

‚∏ª

üîÑ Animations That Loop or Cascade

More visual rhythm to fill otherwise idle space.
  ‚Ä¢  Face scrunch + relax: Periodic tensing like a yawn or sigh.
  ‚Ä¢  Ripple pulse: Background colour ripple or gentle bounce on occasion.
  ‚Ä¢  Split-second side glance: Feels alive and aware.
