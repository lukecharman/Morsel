 * Fix the bug where the unlock of the weekly digest isn't immediate as soon as you tap the notification.
 * Add an optional speech bubble above Morsel with a small phrase inside.
 * Host a JSON file somewhere to remotely update these small phrases.
 * Finalise Morsel himself – add more expressions and make him feel more alive.
    - Does he need eyebrows?
    - Does he need a talking animation while the speech bubble is visible?
    - Should he speak Simlish or Animal Crossing like?
    - I want MVP, but MV Lovable P.
 * Finalise all app icons.
 * Profile for optimisations to memory and framerate, etc.
 * Get it on TestFlight, write a blurb, do screenshots, etc.
 * Use it for a couple of weeks on phone and watch, find bugs, do proper testing.

--------
 * Food ranking system using an open API or a big local JSON.
 * Figure out this custom AppEntity thing for speaking the item in one term to Siri.
 * Add some reminder notifications, NOT NAGS. Maybe with a reminder time? User can select up to 3 times per day?
 * Togglable widget background showing red to green for food for you versus Morsel that day?
 * Daily goal streaks?

Future Ideas
------------
🫧 Micro-Reactions (Contextual, Lightweight)

Subtle and ambient behaviours to reflect mood, interaction, or state.
  •  Glance at user input: If you’re typing something in the text field, Morsel’s eyes follow the keyboard or cursor.
  •  Idle fidgets: Finger tap, ear twitch, slow stretch, light bounce, tiny sneeze.
  •  Reactive glow: His fill colour pulses or shifts very gently based on time of day or app theme.
  •  Eye darting: If he’s idle too long, he looks suspiciously left and right.

⸻

😮 Big Emotes (Triggered by Events)

More obvious, more animated. Only for key transitions.
  •  Happy dance / spin: After a successful add. Maybe even randomise the move slightly.
  •  Shudder or disgust: When deleting something.
  •  Impatient tapping or snoring: If left open without input for too long.
  •  Blush / sparkle: When given a food he “likes” (i.e. you could add a favourites mechanic).
  •  Heart bubble: Occasionally floats up from his head when “fed”.

⸻

🎮 Mini Interactions

Tiny interactions that are not essential but feel delightful.
  •  Petting: Tapping and holding causes him to smile, melt, or waggle a limb.
  •  Tilt-based expressions: On device tilt (if phone), his gravity shifts slightly.
  •  Ticklish spot: There’s one part of him that reacts differently (corner tap easter egg).
  •  Dressing up: A small seasonal hat or overlay (e.g. pumpkin, santa hat, sunglasses).

⸻

🧠 Behaviour That Learns

This is advanced, but fits your theme of Morsel evolving.
  •  Mood tracking: Based on how often he’s “fed” vs. ignored, he could look perkier or a bit sluggish.
  •  Expression changes over day: Maybe he’s sleepy in the morning and smug after dinner.
  •  Custom animation per user: Favourite foods give him unique reactions over time.

⸻

🔄 Animations That Loop or Cascade

More visual rhythm to fill otherwise idle space.
  •  Face scrunch + relax: Periodic tensing like a yawn or sigh.
  •  Ripple pulse: Background colour ripple or gentle bounce on occasion.
  •  Split-second side glance: Feels alive and aware.
